<h1> Funded PhD Studentship in Algebra at the University of Leeds</h1>


<h2>About the Programme</h2>

<p>Research covers key areas of algebra, geometry, mathematical physics and topology. This reaches from the study of algebras, group theory (including Lie groups/algebraic groups), Lie algebras, Hopf algebras, (higher) category theory, representation theory and homological algebra to algebraic geometry, differential and difference equations, braid groups, configuration spaces, surfaces and manifolds, and to mathematics on the interface of algebra with topology and mathematical physics, such as the pentagon equation, skew braces, (extended) topological quantum field theories, higher Lie and gauge theory, mathematical models for topological phases of matter and the ensuing paradigms for topological quantum computing. There are also strong connections to Logic, where topics such as algebraic topology, category theory, categorical and homotopical algebra, model theory, permutation groups, surreal numbers and ordered fields play a role in the interface. 
</p>

<p>This is a strong and active area of research. There are many collaborations and interactions between researchers across these areas, both at Leeds and externally, and there is a thriving community of postdoctoral researchers (supported in part by a substantial EPSRC Programme Grant in combinatorial representation theory) and PhD students, as well as regular seminars in Algebra and in Mathematical Physics.
