Take a taxi to the University (to "the Parkinson steps"). Get a
receipt.  Facing the steps turn left, walk, go under the redbrick arch
on your right. Go straight, take the first left, down some steps,
straight under a  covered walkway, up to a red automatic side-sliding
door in front of you (to the right of a long broad flight of steps
down). Enter through the door. You are now in a long corridor. Go to
the right of the steps in front of you, right to the end of the
corridor, turn right, * then immediately right again (into the Maths
Coffee Bar), down the flight of stairs immediately to your left.  You
are now on level 9 of the School of Maths, where coffee  will be
served in the morning.  If you arrive too late for coffee, we'll lunch
at the SCR. Same instructions up to * then go straight to (almost) end
of corridor, turn left through exterior door, down one flight of
steps, through door on right. You are now in the SCR/Staff bar. The
food counter is through an arch to your right, the dining area through
some doors on your left.  If in doubt, head for level 9 of the School
of Maths.
